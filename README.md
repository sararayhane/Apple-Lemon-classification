# Apple-Lemon-classification
This repository contains Colab notebook and dataset for a simple lemon and apple classification task using machine learning, to train a model to distinguish between images of lemons and apples.
##Dataset 
The dataset used for this project consists of images of lemons and apples. The images are divided into two folders, lemons and apples, each folder contains images of the respective fruit.
note that the dataset is provided in a zipped format (dataset.zip). You can download and extract it to the appropriate location before running the Colab notebook.
#Colab Notebook
The Colab notebook (Lemon_and_Apple_Classification.ipynb) guides you through the process of loading the dataset, preprocessing the images, building a classification model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
The notebook uses Python.
